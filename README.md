# Indeks Media Inklusif

"Assigned Data Jan-Dec.xlsx" and "Backup Sample Jan-Dec.xlsx" contain articles that need to be coded by the coders. These are the results of the sampling process described in the report.

"CODESHEET - INDEKS MEDIA INKLUSIF.xlsx" contains original scores from the coders. "Coded Data from Coders" is a cleaned-up version of "CODESHEET - INDEKS MEDIA INKLUSIF.xlsx".

"Lembar Responden - Agama.xlsx", "Lembar Responden - Disabilitas.xlsx", "Lembar Responden - Minoritas Seksual.xlsx", and "Lembar Responden - Perempuan.xlsx" contain scores from the external coders.

To analyze the data, all one needs is to run "Remotivi Analysis.R". This is the root script that calls the other scripts. It is not advisable to run the scripts individually as they are quite interdependent and might take input from the other scripts.
